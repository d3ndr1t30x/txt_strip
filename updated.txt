Bash-con
Bash is essential for automating tasks in Linux, making it a key skill for penetration 
testers. This chapter covers setting up your environment, key Linux commands, 
and Bash basics like variables, arrays, streams, arguments, and operators.
Environmental Setup-con
Before learning Bash, you'll need a Bash shell and a text editor. This section 
explains how to access them on any major OS.

Linux/macOS: Bash is pre-installed. Open the Terminal with ALT+CTRL+T on Linux 
or via Launchpad on macOS. Since Kali and macOS use Z Shell by default, switch 
to Bash with exec bash . To set Bash as your default shell, run chsh -s /bin/bash .
Windows-con
To run Bash on Windows, use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and follow 
the installation instructions at Microsoft WSL. Alternatively, install Cygwin, which 
emulates a Linux environment. Save your scripts in the Cygwin home directory 
(C:/cygwin64/home/your_username) to run them from the Cygwin terminal.
Here are the links for the installations mentioned:
1. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL): Microsoft WSL Installation
2. Cygwin: Cygwin Installation
Installing a Text Editor-con
To write Bash scripts, you'll need a text editor with syntax highlighting. You can 
use terminal-based editors like vi or nano for penetration tests, or graphical 
editors like Sublime Text. In Sublime, enable syntax highlighting by selecting "Plain 
Text" in the bottom-right corner and choosing Bash. For other editors, consult 
their documentation for syntax highlighting options.
Exploring the Shell
With your Bash environment set up, start learning by running commands in the 
terminal to test them before adding them to scripts. Verify that Bash is available by 
running:
bash --version
Checking Environment Variables-con
Bash loads a set of environment variables with each terminal session, storing 
information like the user’s identity, home directory, and default shell.
To view all environment variables, run:
env

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
4
To read a specific variable, use the echo  command. For example, to print the 
default shell:
echo ${SHELL}
This command expands the SHELL variable to display its value. Table 1-2 lists 
some common default environment variables.
Variable name
What It Returns
BASH_VERSION
The bash version running
BASHPID
The process ID of the current bash process

The full list of environment variables are here: 
https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash- Variables.html.
Elements of a Bash Script-con
This section covers the fundamentals of a Bash script, including using comments 
for documentation, specifying an interpreter, and formatting for readability.
While Bash lacks an official style guide, consistent coding conventions are vital, 
especially in team environments. Good practices enhance readability and 
efficiency, particularly in exploit code repositories.
The Shebang Line

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
5
Every script should start with a shebang line, which begins with #! , followed by 
the full path to the script interpreter. For a typical Bash script, the shebang looks 
like this:
#!/bin/bash
This specifies the Bash interpreter, typically located at /bin/bash . If you were using 
Python or Ruby, the path would point to those interpreters.
You may also encounter a more portable shebang line:
#!/usr/bin/env bash
This version searches the system for the Bash interpreter, useful in cases where 
the interpreter's location varies across Linux distributions. This can be particularly 
helpful in penetration testing environments, where the location of Bash might be 
unknown on the target system. However, for simplicity, we'll use the version from 
the first example throughout this book.
The shebang line can also accept optional arguments to modify script execution. 
For instance:
#!/bin/bash -x
This enables debugging by printing each command and its arguments as they are 
executed. Another example:
#!/bin/bash -r
This creates a restricted shell, preventing certain commands from being executed, 
like navigating to certain directories or modifying sensitive environment variables.
You can also pass arguments directly to the Bash interpreter on the command line, 
as shown here:

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
6
bash -r myscript.sh
Whether you pass arguments on the command line or in the shebang line, the 
result is the same. Using the command line is simply a more flexible way to trigger 
different modes.
Comments
Comments in Bash are lines of text that the interpreter ignores, making them 
useful for documenting code and improving readability. For example, if you write a 
long script and need to update it years later, comments will help you understand 
the logic behind each section.
In Bash, comments begin with a pound sign ( # ), as seen below:
#!/bin/bash
# This is my first script.
Except for the shebang line, any line that starts with #  is treated as a comment. 
Even if you include a second shebang, it will be ignored as a comment.
For multiline comments, simply start each line with a # , like this:
#!/bin/bash
# This is my first script!
# Bash scripting is fun...
Additional Uses of Comments
Beyond explaining logic, comments can include metadata such as the author’s 
name, the script version, or contact information for reporting issues. These 
comments are typically placed at the top of the script, just below the shebang line.
Commands

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
7
A Bash script can be as simple as two lines: the shebang line and a Linux 
command. Let's create a basic script that prints "Hello World" to the terminal. 
Open a text editor and enter the following:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World!"
Here, the shebang line specifies Bash as the interpreter, and the echo  command 
prints the string "Hello World!" to the terminal.
Execution
To run the script, save it as helloworld.sh. Open the terminal and navigate to the 
directory where the script is saved. For example, if it's in your home directory, use 
the following commands:
cd ~
chmod u+x helloworld.sh
./helloworld.sh
Output:
Hello World!
The cd  command changes directories. The tilde ( ~ ) represents the current 
user's home directory.
chmod u+x  grants the user (you) execute permission for the script.
./helloworld.sh  runs the script from the current directory. The ./  notation 
indicates that the script resides in the current working directory.
Alternatively, you can run the script using the Bash command directly:
bash helloworld.sh

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
8
In this case, the script runs without needing executable permissions or a shebang 
line since you are explicitly invoking Bash to execute the file.
Later, we'll dive deeper into file permissions and their importance, especially when 
identifying misconfigurations during penetration tests.
Debugging
Errors are inevitable when developing Bash scripts, but debugging is 
straightforward. A simple method for checking errors early is using the -n  
parameter. This option reads the script without executing it, revealing any syntax 
errors—a useful way to perform a "dry run" to validate the syntax:
bash -n script.sh
For real-time debugging, you can use the -x  parameter to enable verbose mode, 
which displays each command as it’s executed, helping you track down issues:
bash -x script.sh
If you want to debug only a specific part of your script, you can control when 
debugging starts and stops by using the set  command within the script:
#!/bin/bash
set -x
# Commands you want to debug
set +x
Here, set -x  enables debugging, and set +x  disables it. This approach limits the 
amount of output noise in your terminal, especially when debugging larger scripts 
with specific problem areas.
Basic Syntax

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
9
You've written a simple two-line script that prints "Hello World!" and learned how 
to run and debug scripts. Now, let’s explore basic Bash syntax to write more 
complex scripts.
At its core, a Bash script is a collection of Linux commands in a single file. For 
example, here’s a script that creates a directory, adds a file to it, and then lists the 
directory contents:
#!/bin/bash
# This script creates a directory, adds a file inside it,
# and lists the directory contents.
mkdir mydirectory
touch mydirectory/myfile
ls -l mydirectory
In this example:
mkdir  creates a directory named mydirectory.
touch  creates an empty file named myfile within the directory.
ls -l  lists the contents of the directory, showing details like permissions, 
owner, and timestamp.
The output of the script might look like this:
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 0 Feb 16 13:37 myfile
While this line-by-line approach works, it can be improved. For example, Bash 
waits for each command to complete before moving to the next, so if a command 
like file copying takes a long time, subsequent commands will be delayed. 
Additionally, there are no checks to ensure that each command succeeds, which 
can lead to runtime errors.
Writing more advanced scripts involves using features like variables, conditions, 
loops, and tests. For example, you might want to:
Check available disk space before creating files and directories.

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
10
Verify whether the directory and file creation actions were successful.
The following sections will introduce these syntactical elements, allowing you to 
write more intelligent and reliable Bash scripts.
Variables
In Bash, variables are names assigned to memory locations that store values, 
acting as placeholders. You can assign values directly to variables or use the 
output of Bash commands to store results in variables for later use.
Unlike many programming languages where variables have specific types (e.g., 
integers, strings, arrays), Bash variables are untyped and treated as character 
strings. However, you can still create arrays, access elements, and perform 
arithmetic operations on numeric values.
Naming Rules for Bash Variables
Variables can include alphanumeric characters.
Variables cannot start with a numerical character.
They can contain underscores ( _ ).
They cannot contain whitespace.
Assigning and Accessing Variables
To assign a variable, use the following syntax. For example:
book="shell scripting"
This creates a variable named book  and assigns it the value "Bash Scripting" . You 
can then use this variable in commands. For example, to print the variable's value:
echo "This book's name is ${book}"
This book's name is shell scripting
Output:

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
11
 
This book's name is Bash Scripting
Here, ${book}  expands to the value of the book  variable.
You can also assign the output of a command to a variable using command 
substitution ( $() ):
$ root_directory="$(ls -ld /)"
$ echo "${root_directory}"
Output:
drwxr-xr-x 1 user user 12 Feb 13 20:12 /
This assigns the output of ls -ld /  to the variable root_directory  and then prints it. 
The output provides metadata about the root directory, including permissions, 
size, owner, and modification timestamp.
Important: When assigning a value to a variable, do not leave 
whitespace around the = sign. For example, the following is 
invalid:
book = "this is an invalid variable assignment"
Unassigning Variables
To unassign (unset) a variable, use the unset  command:
$ book="Bash Scripting"
$ unset book
$ echo "${book}"
Output:

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
12
(no output, as the variable has been unset)
Scoping Variables
Global variables are those available to the entire program. But variables in bash 
can also be scoped so that they are only accessible from within a certain block of 
code. These variables are called local variables and are declared using the local 
keyword. The following script shows how local and global variables work:
#!/bin/bash
PUBLISHER="No Starch Press"
print_name(){
local name
name="Bash Scripting"
echo "${name} by ${PUBLISHER}"
}
print_name
echo "The variable ${name} will not be printed because it is a local variable."
We assign the value No Starch Press to the variable publisher, then create a 
function called print_name(). ( You’ll learn more about functions in the next 
chapter.) Within the function, we declare a local variable called name and assign it 
the value "Bash Scripting". Then we call the print_name() function and attempt to 
access the name variable as part of a sentence to be printed using echo.
The echo command at the end of the script file will result in an empty variable, as 
the name variable is locally scoped to the

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
13
print_name() function, which means that nothing outside of the function can 
access it. So, it will simply return without a value.
Save this script, remembering to set the executable permission using chmod, and 
run it using the following command:
./local_scope_variable.sh
The variable will not be printed because it is a local variable.
Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators allow you to perform mathematical
operations on integers. Table 1-3 shows some of the arithmetic operators 
available. The full list of the available arithmetic operators can be found at 
https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/ops.html.
Table 1-3 Arithmetic Operators
Operator
Description
 
`
+
Addition
-
Subtraction
*
Multiplication
/
Division
%
Modulo
+=
Incrementing by a constant
-=
Decrementing by a constant
You can perform these arithmetic operations in bash in a few ways: using the let 
command, using the double parentheses syntax $((expression)), and using the 
expr command. Let’s
consider an example of each method.

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
14
Here we perform a multiplication operation using the let command:
$ **let result="4 * 5"**
$ **echo $result**
20
This command takes a variable name, then performs an
arithmetic calculation to resolve its value. Next, we perform another multiplication 
operation using the double parentheses syntax:
$ **result=$((5 * 5))**
$ **echo $result**
25
In this case, we perform the calculation within double parentheses. Lastly, we 
perform an addition operation using the expr command:
$ **result=$(expr 5 + 505)**
$ **echo $result**
510
The expr command evaluates expressions, which don’t have to be arithmetic 
operations; for example, you might use it to calculate the length of some string. 
Use man expr to learn more about the capabilities of expr.
Arrays
Bash allows you to create single-dimension arrays. Arrays are a collection of 
elements that are indexed. You can access these

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
15
elements using their index numbers, where the first indexed number starts from 
zero. In bash scripts, you might use arrays whenever you need to iterate over a 
number of strings and run the same commands on each one.
Here is how to create an array in bash. Save this code to a file named array.sh and 
execute it.
#!/bin/bash
# Set an array
IP_ADDRESSES=(192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3)
# Print all elements in the array
echo "${IP_ADDRESSES[*]}"
# Print only the first element in the array
echo "${IP_ADDRESSES[0]}"
This script uses an array named IP_ADDRESSES that contains three IP addresses. 
The first echo command prints all the elements in the array by passing [*] to the 
variable name IP_ADDRESSES, which holds the array values. The * is a 
representation of every array element. Lastly, another echo command prints just 
the first element in the array by specifying index zero.
Running this script should produce the following output:
$ **chmod u+x arrays.sh**
$ **./arrays.sh**
192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3
192.168.1.1

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
16
As you can see, we were able to get bash to print all elements in the array, as well 
as just the first element.
You can also delete elements from an array. The following will delete 192.168.1.2 
from the array:
IP_ADDRESSES=(192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3)
unset IP_ADDRESSES[1]
You can even swap one of the values with another value. The following code will 
replace 192.168.1.1 with 192.168.1.10:
IP_ADDRESSES[0]="192.168.1.10"
You’ll find arrays particularly useful when you need to iterate over values and 
perform actions against them, such as a list of IP addresses to scan (or a list of 
emails to send a phishing email to).
 
Streams
Streams are files that act as communication channels between a program and its 
environment. When you interact with a program (whether a built-in Linux utility 
such as ls or mkdir or one that you wrote yourself), you’re interacting with one or 
more streams. In bash, there are three standard data streams, as shown in Table 
1-4.
Table 1-4 Streams
Stream name
Description
File descriptor
number
Standard Input (stdin)
Data coming into some program as
input
0
Standard Output
(stdout)
Data coming out of a program
1
Standard Error (stderr)
Errors coming out of a program
2

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
17
So far, we’ve run a few commands from the terminal and written and executed a 
simple script. The generated output was all sent to the standard output stream 
(stdout), or in other words, your terminal screen.
Scripts can also receive commands as input. When a script is designed to receive 
input, it reads it from the standard input stream (stdin). Lastly, scripts may display 
error messages to the screen due to a bug or syntax error in the commands sent 
to it. These messages are sent to the standard error stream (stderr).
To illustrate streams, we’ll use the mkdir command to create a few directories and 
then use ls to list the content of the current directory. Open your terminal and 
execute the following command:
$ **mkdir directory1 directory2 directory1**
mkdir: cannot create directory 'directory1': File exists
$ **ls -l**
total 1
drwxr-xr-x 1 user user 0 Feb 17 09:45 directory1
drwxr-xr-x 1 user user 0 Feb 17 09:45 directory
Notice that the mkdir command generated an error. This is because we passed 
the directory name directory1 twice on the command line. So, when mkdir ran, it 
created directory1, created directory2, and then failed on the third argument 
because, at that point, directory1 had already been created. These types of errors 
are sent to the standard error stream.
Next, we executed ls-l, which simply listed the directories. The result of the ls 
command succeeded without any specific errors, so it was sent to the standard 
output stream.
You’ll practice working with the standard input stream when we introduce 
redirection in “Redirection Operators” on page XX.

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
18
Control Operators
Control operators in bash are tokens that perform a control function. Table 1-5 
gives an overview of control operators.
Table 1-5 Bash Control Operators
Operator
Description
&
Sends a command to the background.
&&
Used as a logical AND. The second command in the expression will be
evaluated only if the first command evaluated to true.
( and )
Used for command grouping
;
Used as a list terminator. A command following the terminator will run af-
ter the preceding command has finished, regardless of whether it evalu-
ates to true or not.
;;
Ends a case statement.
|
Redirects the output of a command as input to another command.
||
Used as a logical OR. The second command will run if the first one evalu-
ates to false.
Let’s see some of these control operators in action. The &
operator sends any command to the background. If you have a list of commands 
in a shell script, sending the first command to the
background will allow bash to continue to the next line even if the previous 
command hasn’t finished its work. Commands that are long-running are often sent 
to the background to prevent scripts from hanging.
#!/bin/bash
# This script will send the sleep command to the background
echo "Sleeping for 10 seconds..."
sleep 10 &
# Creates a file

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
19
echo "Creating the file test123"
touch test123
# Delete a file
echo "Deleting the file test123"
rm test123
 
You’ll learn about sending commands to the background in more depth when we 
discuss job control in Chapter 2.
The && operator allows us to perform an AND operation between two commands. 
In this case, the file test123 will be created only if the first command was 
successful:
touch test && touch test123
The () operator allows us to group commands together so they act a single unit 
when we need to redirect them together:
(ls; ps)
This is generally useful when you need to redirect results from multiple commands 
to some stream, as shown in “Redirection Operations” on page XX.
The ; operator allows us to run multiple commands irrespective of their exit status:
ls; ps; whoami
As a result, each command is executed one after the other, as soon as the 
previous one finishes.
The || operator allows us to chain commands together using an OR operator:
lzl || echo "the lzl command failed"

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
20
In this example, the echo command will be executed only if the first command 
fails.
Redirection Operators
The three standard streams we highlighted earlier can be
redirected from one program to another. Redirection is taking some output from 
one command or script and using it as the input to another. Table 1-6 describes 
the available redirection operators.
Table 1-6 Redirection Operators
Operator
Description
>
Redirects stdout to a file
>>
Redirects stdout to a file by appending it to the existing content
&> or >&
Redirects stdout and stderr to a file
&>>
Redirects stdout and stderr to a file by appending it to the existing
content
<
Redirects input to a command
<<
Called a heredocument or heredoc, redirects multiple input lines to a
com-mand
 
`
|
Redirects output of a command as input to another command
Let’s practice using redirection operators to see how they work with standard 
streams. The > operator redirects the standard output stream to a file. Any 
command that precedes this character will send its output to the specified 
location. Run the following command directly in your terminal:
$ echo "Hello World!" > output.txt
We redirected the standard output stream to a file named
output.txt. To see the content of output.txt, simply run the following:

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
21
cat output.txt
Hello World!
Next, we’ll use the >> operator to append some content to the end of the same 
file:
echo "Goodbye!" >> output.txt
cat hello_output.txt
Hello World!
Goodbye!
Listing 1-10 Append text to a file
If we used > instead of >>, the content of output.txt would have been overwritten 
completely with the Goodbye! text.
You can redirect both the standard output stream and the standard error stream to 
a file using &>. This is useful when you don’t want to send any output to the 
screen and instead save everything in a log file (perhaps for later analysis).
ls -l / &> stdout_and_stderr.txt
Listing 1-11 Redirecting standard output and standard error streams to a file
To append both the standard output and standard error streams to a file, simply 
use double chevron (&>>).
What if we wanted to send the standard output stream to one file, and the 
standard error stream to another? This is also possible using the streams’ file 
descriptor numbers:
$ ls -l / 1> stdout.txt 2> stderr.txt
Listing 1-12 Redirecting standard output and standard error to separate files

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
22
You may sometimes find it useful to redirect the standard error stream to a file, as 
we’ve done here, so you can log any errors that occur during runtime. For 
example, the next example runs a non- existent command lzl. This should 
generate bash errors that will be written into the error.txt file.
lzl 2> error.txt
cat error.txt
bash: lz: command not found
Listing 1-13 Redirecting the standard error stream using its file descriptor number
Notice that you didn’t see the error on the screen because bash sent the error to 
the file instead.
Next, let’s use the standard input stream. Run the following command in the shell 
to supply the contents of output.txt as input to the cat command:
cat < output.txt
Hello World!
Goodbye!
Listing 1-14 Redirecting standard input to the cat command
What if we wanted to redirect multiple lines to a command? Here document 
redirection (<<) can help with this:
$ **cat << EOF**
**Bash Scripting**
****
**EOF**

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
23
Bash Scripting
Listing 1-15 A here document
In this example, we pass multiple lines as input to a command.
The EOF in this example acts as a delimiter marking the start and end points of the 
input. Here document redirection treats the input as if it were a separate file, 
preserving line breaks and whitespace.
The pipe operator (|) redirects the output of one command and uses it as the input 
of another. For example, we could run the ls command on the root directory and 
then use another command to extract some data from it, as shown here:
$ **ls -l / | grep "bin"**
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Mar 10 08:43 bin -> usr/bin
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 8 Mar 10 08:43 sbin -> usr/sbin
Listing 1-16 Piping a commands output as input to another command
We used ls to print the content of the root directory into the standard output 
stream, then used pipe (|) to send it as input to the grep command, which filtered 
out any lines containing the word bin.
Positional Arguments
Bash scripts can take positional arguments (also called
parameters) passed on the command line. Arguments are especially useful, for 
example, when you want to develop a program that modifies its behavior based on 
some input passed to it by another program or user. Arguments can also change 
features of the script such as the output format and how verbose it will be during 
runtime.
For example, imagine you develop an exploit and send it to a few colleagues, each 
of whom will use it against a different IP address. Instead of writing a script and 

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
24
asking the user to modify it with their network information, you can write it to take 
an IP address argument and then act against this input to avoid having to modify 
the source code in each case.
A bash script can access arguments passed to it on the command line using the 
variables $1, $2, and so on. The number represents the order in which the 
argument was entered. To illustrate this, the following script takes in an argument 
(an IP address or domain name) and performs a ping test against it using the ping 
utility.
Save this file as ping_with_arguments.sh:
Listing 1-17 A pinger command
#!/bin/bash
# This script will ping any address provided as an argument.

TARGET="${1}"
echo "Running the script ${SCRIPT_NAME}..."
echo "Pinging the target: ${TARGET}..."

This script assigns the first positional argument to the variable TARGET. Notice, 
also, that the argument ${0} is assigned to the SCRIPT_NAME variable. This 
argument contains the script’s name (in this case, ping_with_arguments.sh).
To run this script, use the following commands:
chmod u+x ping_with_arguments.sh
./ping_with_arguments.sh example.com

Listing 1-18 Passing arguments to a script
This script will perform a ping command against the domain example.com passed 
to it on the command line. The value was assigned to the $1 variable; if we passed 
another argument, it would get assigned to the second variable, $2. Use CTRL+C 
to exit this script, as ping may run indefinitely on some operating systems.
This script is available at https://github.com/dolevf/Black-Hat-
Bash/blob/master/ch01/ping_with_arguments.sh.
What if you wanted to access all arguments? You can do so using the variable $@. 
Also, using $#, you can get the total number of arguments passed. The following 
script demonstrates how this works:
#!/bin/bash
echo "The arguments are: $@"
echo "The total number of arguments are: $#"
Save this script to a file named *show_args.sh* and run it as fo
$ **chmod u+x show_args.sh**

$@
All positional arguments, where each argument is individually quoted
When a script makes use of "$*" with the quotes included, bash will expand 
arguments into a single word. For instance, the
following groups the arguments into one word:
$ **script.sh "1" "2" "3"**
1 2 3
When a script makes use of "$@" (again including the quotes), it will expand 
arguments into separate words:
$ **script.sh "1" "2" "3"**

3
In most cases, you will want to use "$@" so that every argument is treated as an 
individual word.

Input Prompting
Some bash scripts don’t take any arguments during execution. However, they may 
need to ask the user for some information in an interactive way and have the 
response feed into their runtime. In these cases, we can use the read command. 
You often see
applications use input prompting when attempting to install some software, asking 
the user to enter yes to proceed or no to cancel the operation.
In the following bash script, we ask the user for their first and last name, then print 
these to the standard output stream.
#!/bin/bash
# Takes input from the user and assigns it to variables.
echo "What is your first name?"
read -r firstname
echo "What is your last name?"
read -r lastname
echo "Your first name is ${firstname} and your last name is ${la
Listing 1-19 Accepting user input with bash

Exit Status Codes
Bash commands return status codes, which indicate whether the execution of the 
command succeeded. Status codes fall in the 0–255 range, where 0 means 
success, 1 means failure, 126 means that the command was found but is not 
executable, and 127 means the command was not found. The meaning of any 
other number depends on the specific command being used and the logic it uses.
Checking Status Codes
To see status codes in action, save the following script to a file named 
exit_codes.sh and run it.
#!/bin/bash
# Experimenting with status codes
ls -l > /dev/null
echo "The status code of the ls command was: $?"
lzl 2> /dev/null
echo "The status code of the non-existing lzl command was: $?"
We use the special variable $? with the echo command to return the status codes 
of the executed commands ls and lzl. We also redirect their standard output and 
standard error streams to the file /dev/null, a special device file that discards any 
data sent to it. When you want to silence commands, you can redirect their output 
to it.
 

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
29
`
You should see output like the following:
$ ./exit_codes.sh
The status code of the ls command was: 0
The status code of the non-existing lzl command was: 127
As you can see, we received two distinct status codes, one for each command. 
The first command returned 0 (success), and the second returned 127 (command 
not found).
NOTE Use /dev/null with caution. You may miss out on important errors if you 
choose to redirect output to it. When in doubt, redirect standard streams such as 
standard output and standard error to a dedicated log file in-stead.
To understand why you might want to use status codes, imagine you’re trying to 
download a 1GB file from the internet using bash. It might be wise to first check if 
the file already exists on the
filesystem in case someone ran the script already and retrieved it. Also, you might 
want to check that you have enough free space on the disk before attempting the 
download. By running commands and looking at their exit status codes, we can 
decide whether to proceed with the file download.
Setting a Script’s Exit Codes
You can set the exit code of a script using the exitcommand, as shown below:
#!/bin/bash
# Sets the exit code of the script to be 223
echo "Exiting with status code: 223"
exit 223

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
30
Save this script as set_status_code.sh and run it on the command line, then use 
the special variable $? to see the status code it returns:
$ chmod u+x set_status_code.sh
$ ./set_status_code.sh
Exiting with status code: 223
echo $?
223
$? to see the status code it returns:
$ **chmod u+x set_status_code.sh**
$ **./set_status_code.sh**
Exiting with status code: 223
**echo $?**
223
You can use the $?variable to check the exit status of a script, but also of 
individual commands:
$ **ps -ef**
$ **echo $?**
0
Exit codes are important when you have a series of scripts that call one another. 
You may have a workflow where one script invokes another depending on a state 
of a specific condition.

ADVANCED BASH CONCEPTS
This chapter covers bash concepts that can make your scripts more intelligent. 
You’ll learn how to test
conditions, use loops, consolidate code into functions, send commands to the 
background, and more. You’ll also learn some ways of customizing your bash 
environment for penetration testing.
Test Operators
Bash lets us selectively execute commands when certain conditions of interest are 
met. We can use test operators to craft a wide variety of conditions, such as 
whether one value equals another value, whether a file is of a certain type, or 
whether one value is greater than another. We often rely on such tests to 
determine
  
whether to continue running a block of code or not, so being able to construct 
them is fundamental to bash programming.
There are multiple kinds of test operators. File test operators allow us to perform 
tests against files on the filesystem, such as checking if a file is executable or if 
some directory exists. Table 2-1 shows a short list of the available tests.
Table 2-1 File Test Operators
Operator
Description
-dFILE
Checks whether the file is a directory
-rFILE
Checks whether the file is readable
-xFILE
Checks whether the file is executable
-wFILE
Checks whether the file is writable
-fFILE
Checks whether the file is a regular file
-s FILE
Checks whether the file size is greater than zero
You can find the full list of file test operators at https://ss64.com/bash/test.html.
String comparison operators allow us to perform tests related to strings, such as 
testing whether one string is equal to another. Table 2-2 shows the string 
comparison operators.

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
32
Table 2-2 String Comparison Operators
Operator
Description
=
Checks whether a string is equal to another string
==
Synonym of = when used within [[ ]] constructs
!=
Checks whether a string is not equal to another string
<
Checks whether a string comes before another string (in alphabetical
order)
>
Checks whether a string comes after another string (in alphabetical
order)
-z
Checks whether a string is null
-n
Checks whether a string is not null
Integer comparison operators allow us to perform checks on integers, such as if 
an integer is less than or greater than another. Table 2-3 shows the available 
operators.
Table 2-3 Integer Comparison Operators
Operator
Description
-eq
Checks whether a number is equal to another number
-ne
Checks whether a number is not equal to another number
-ge
Checks whether a number is greater than or equal to another number
-gt
Checks whether a number is greater than another number
-lt
Checks whether a number is less than another number
-le
Checks whether a number is less than or equal to another number
Let’s use these operators in flow-control mechanisms to decide what code to run 
next.
If Conditions
In bash, we can use an if condition to execute some code only when a condition is 
met. Its syntax is as follows:
if [[ condition ]]; then

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
33
# do something if the condition is met
else
# do something if the condition is not met
fi
We start with the if keyword, followed by a test conditions between double 
brackets ([[ ]]). We then use the ; character to separate the if keyword from the 
then keyword, which allows us to introduce a block of code that runs only if the 
condition is true.
Next, we use the else keyword to introduce a fallback code block that runs if the 
condition is not met. Note that else is optional, and you may not always need it. 
Finally, we close the if condition with the fi keyword (which is if inversed).
N O T E In some operating systems, such as those often used in containers, the 
default shell might not necessarily be bash. To account for these cases, you may 
want to use single brackets ([…]) rather than double brackets to enclose your 
condition. This use of single brackets meets the POSIX standard and should work 
on almost any Unix derivative, including Linux.
Let’s see an if condition in practice. Listing 2-1 uses an if condition to test whether 
a file exists, and if not, creates it.
#!/bin/bash
FILENAME="flow_control_with_if.txt"
if [[ -f "${FILENAME}" ]]; then
echo "${FILENAME} already exists."
exit 1
else
touch "${FILENAME}"

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
34
fi
Listing 2-1 An if condition to test for the existence of a file
We first create a variable named FILENAME containing the name of the file we 
need. This saves us from having to repeat the filename in the code. We then 
introduce the if statement, which uses a condition that tests for the existence of 
files with the -f file test operator. If this condition is true, we use echo to print to 
the screen a message explaining that the file already exists and then exit the 
program using the status code 1 (failure). Using the else block, which will execute 
only if the file does not exist, we create the file using the touch
command.
You can download this script from https://github.com/dolevf/Black-Hat- 
Bash/blob/master/ch02/test_if_file_exists.sh. Save the file and execute it. You 
should see the flow_control_with_if.txt file in your current directory when you run 
ls.
Listing 2-2 shows a different way of achieving the same outcome; it uses the not 
operator (!) to check whether a directory doesn’t exist, and if so, creates it. This 
example has fewer lines of code and eliminates the need for an else block 
altogether.
#!/bin/bash
FILENAME="flow_control_with_if.txt"
if [[ ! -f "${FILENAME}" ]]; then
touch "${FILENAME}"
fi
Listing 2-2 An example of a file test using a negative check

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
35
Save and run this script. It should create a directory named downloads if this 
directory wasn’t already present.
Let’s explore if conditions that use some of the other kinds of test operators we’ve 
covered. Listing 2-3 shows an example of a string comparison test. It tests 
whether two variables are equal by performing string comparison with the equal-
to operator (==).
#!/bin/bash
VARIABLE_ONE="nostarch"
VARIABLE_TWO="nostarch"
if [[ "${VARIABLE_ONE}" == "${VARIABLE_TWO}" ]]; then echo "They
else
echo "They are not equal!"
fi
Listing 2-3 A string comparison test comparing two string variables
The script will compare the two variables, both of which have the value nostarch, 
and print They are equal! by using the echo command. It is available at 
https://github.com/dolevf/Black-Hat-
Bash/blob/master/ch02/string_comparison.sh.
Next is an example of an integer comparison test, which takes two integers and 
checks which one is the larger number.
#!/bin/bash
VARIABLE_ONE="10"
VARIABLE_TWO="20"

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
36
 
if [[ "${VARIABLE_ONE}" -gt "${VARIABLE_TWO}" ]]; then
echo "${VARIABLE_ONE} is greater than ${VARIABLE_TWO}" else
echo "${VARIABLE_ONE} is less than ${VARIABLE_TWO}"
fi
We create two variables, VARIABLE_ONE and VARIABLE_TWO, and assign them 
values of 10 and 20, respectively. We then use the -gt operator to compare the 
two values and print the one that is greater. This script is available at
https://github.com/dolevf/Black-Hat-
Bash/blob/master/ch02/integer_comparison.sh.
Linking Conditions
So far, we’ve used if to check whether a single condition is met. But like most 
programming languages, we can also use the or (||) and and (&&) operators to 
check for multiple conditions at once.
For example, what if we wanted to check that a file exists and also that its size 
greater than zero? Listing 2-4 does so.
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World!" > file.txt
if [[ -f "file.txt" ]] && [[ -s "file.txt" ]]; then
echo "The file exists and its size is greater than zero".
fi

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
37
Listing 2-4 Chaining two file-test conditions using an and condition
This code writes some content to a file, then checks whether that file exists and 
whether its size is greater than zero. Both conditions have to be met in order for 
the echo command to be executed. If either returns false, nothing will happen.
To demonstrate an or condition, Listing 2-5 checks whether a file is either of file 
or directory type:
#!/bin/bash
DIR_NAME="dir_test"
mkdir "${DIR_NAME}"
if [[ -f "${DIR_NAME}" ]] || [[ -d "${DIR_NAME}" ]]; then echo "
Listing 2-5 Chaining two file test conditions using or
This code first creates a directory, then uses an if condition with the or (||) 
operator to check whether the variable is a file (-f) or directory (-d). The second 
condition should evaluate to true, and the echo command should execute.
Running Code Only If a Command Succeeds
We can even test the exit code of commands to determine if they were successful 
or not, in this way:
if command; then
# command was successful
fi
if ! command; then
# command was unsuccessful

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
38
fi
Listing 2-6 Testing the exit code of a command
You’ll often find yourself using this technique in bash, as commands aren’t 
guaranteed to succeed. Failures could happen for reasons such as these:
A lack of the necessary permissions when creating resources
An attempt to execute a command that is not available on the operating 
system
The disk being full when downloading a file
The network being down while executing network utilities
To see how this technique works, execute the following in your terminal:
$ **if touch test123; then**
**echo "OK: file created"**
**fi**
OK: file created
We attempt to create a file. Because the file creation succeeds, we print a 
message to indicate this.
Using elif
If the first if condition fails, you can check for other conditions by using the elif 
keyword (short for else if). To show how this works, let’s write a program that 
checks the arguments passed to it on the command line. The script in Listing 2-7 
will output a message clarifying whether the argument is a file or a directory.
#!/bin/bash
USER_INPUT="${1}"

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
39
1 if [[ -z "${USER_INPUT}" ]]; then
echo you must provide an argument!
exit 1
fi
2 if [[ -f "${USER_INPUT}" ]]; then
echo "${USER_INPUT} is a file"
3 elif [[ -d "${USER_INPUT}" ]]; then
echo "${USER_INPUT} is a directory"
else
4 echo "${USER_INPUT} is not a file or a directory"
fi
Listing 2-7 Using if and elif statements
We begin with an if statement that checks whether the variable
USER_INPUT is null 1. This allows us to exit the script early using exit 1 if we 
receive no command line arguments from the user. We then begin a second if 
condition that uses the file test operator to check whether the input is a file 2. 
Below this condition, we use elif to test whether the argument is a directory 3.
This condition won’t be tested unless the file test fails. If neither of these 
conditions is true, the script responds that the argument is neither a file nor a 
directory 4.
This script is available at https://github.com/dolevf/Black-Hat-
Bash/blob/master/ch02/if_elif.sh.

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
40
Functions
Functions help us reuse blocks of code so we can avoid repeating them. They 
allow us to run multiple commands and other bash code together by simply 
entering the function’s name. To define a new function, enter a name for it, 
followed by parentheses (). Then place the code you would like the function to run 
within curly brackets {}:
#!/bin/bash
say_name(){
echo "Bash Scripting"
}
Here, we define a function called say_name that executes a single echo command. 
To call a function, simply enter its name:
say_name
If the function is not called, the commands within it won’t run.
Returning Values
Like commands and their exit statuses, functions can return values using the 
return keyword. If there is no return statement, the function will return the code of 
the last command it ran. For example, the function in Listing 2-8 returns a different 
value based on whether the current user is root or not:
#!/bin/bash
1 check_if_root(){
  
2 if [[ "${EUID}" -eq "0" ]]; then
return 0
else

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
41
return 1
fi
}
3 is_root=$(check_if_root)
4 if [[ "${is_root}" -eq "0" ]]; then
echo "user is root!"
else
echo "user is not root!"
fi
Listing 2-8 An if condition to test whether a function returned true or false
We define the check_if_root function 1. Within this function, we use an if condition 
with an integer comparison test 2, accessing the environment variable EUID to get 
the effective running user’s ID and checking whether it equals 0. If so, the user is 
root, and the function returns 0; if not, it returns 1. Next, we call the function and 
assign the result returned to the variable is_root3. Then we use another integer 
comparison test to determine this value 4. This code is available at 
https://github.com/dolevf/Black-Hat-
Bash/blob/master/ch02/check_root_function.sh.
Bash scripts that perform privileged actions often check whether the user is root 
before attempting to install software, create users, delete groups, and so on.
Attempting to perform privileged actions on Linux without the necessary privileges 
will result in errors, so this check helps handle these cases.
Accepting Arguments

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
42
In the previous chapter, we covered the passing of arguments to commands on 
the command line. Functions can also take arguments using the same syntax. For 
example, the function in Listing 2-9 prints the first three arguments it receives:
#!/bin/bash
print_args(){
echo "first: ${1}, second: ${2}, third: ${3}" }
1 print_args No Starch Press
Listing 2-9 A function with arguments
To call a function with arguments, simply enter its name and the arguments 
separated by spaces 1. Save this script as function_with_args.sh and run it:
$ chmod u+x function_with_args.sh
$ ./function_with_args.sh
#!/bin/bash
print_args(){
echo "first: ${1}, second: ${2}, third: ${3}" }
1 print_args One Two Three
Listing 2-9 A function with arguments
To call a function with arguments, simply enter its name and the
$ **chmod u+x function_with_args.sh**
$ **./function_with_args.sh**
first: No, second: Starch, third: Press
You should see similar output.

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
43
Loops and Loop Controls
Like many programming languages, bash lets you repeat chunks of code using 
loops. Loops can be particularly useful in your penetration testing adventures 
because they can help you accomplish tasks such as the following:
Continuously checking whether an IP address is online after a reboot; once the 
IP address is detected, stop checking.
Iterating through a list of hostnames, for example to run a specific exploit 
against each of them or determine whether there is a firewall protecting them.
Testing for a certain condition and then running a loop when it is met. For 
example, checking whether a host is online, and if so, performing a brute force 
attack against it.
The following sections introduce you to the three kinds of loops in bash, while, 
until, and for, as well as the break and continue statements for working with loops.
while
In bash, while loops allow you to run a code block until some test returns a 
successful exit status code. You might use them in penetration testing to
continuously perform a port scan on a network and pick up any new hosts that 
join the network, for example.
Listing 2-10 shows the syntax of a while loop.
while *some_condition*; do
# run commands while the condition is true
done
Listing 2-10 A while loop
A while loop starts with the keyword while, followed by an expression that 
describes the condition. We then surround the code to be executed with the do 
and done keywords, which define the start and end of the code block.

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
44
You can use while loops to run some chunk of code infinitely by using true as the 
condition; because true always returns a successful exit code, the code will 
always run. Let’s use a while loop to repeatedly print a command to the screen. 
Save this script to a file named basic_while.sh and run it.
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
echo "Looping..."
sleep 2
done
You should see the following output:
$ chmod u+x basic_while.sh
$ **./basic_while.sh**
Looping...
Looping...
- *-snip--*
Next, let’s write a more sophisticated while loop that runs until it finds a specific 
file on the filesystem (use CTRL+C to stop it from executing at any point):
#!/bin/bash
1 SIGNAL_TO_STOP_FILE="stoploop"

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
45
2 while [[ ! -f "${SIGNAL_TO_STOP_FILE}" ]]; do
echo "The file ${SIGNAL_TO_STOP_FILE} does not yet exist..." ech
sleep 2
done
3 echo "File was found! exiting..."
At 1, we define a variable representing the name of the file for which the while 
loop 2 checks using a file test operator. The loop won’t exit until the condition is 
satisfied. Once the file is available, the loop will stop, and the script will continue 
to the echo command 3. Save this file as while_loop.sh and run it:
$ **chmod u+x while_loop.sh**
$**./while_loop.sh**
The file stoploop does not yet exist...
Checking again in 2 seconds...
While the script is running, open a second terminal in the same directory as the 
script and create the stoploop file:
touch stoploop
Once you’ve done so, you should see the script breaking out of the loop and print 
the following:
File was found! exiting...
This script is available at https://github.com/dolevf/Black-Hat-
Bash/blob/master/ch02/while_loop.sh.
until

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
46
Although while runs so long as the condition succeeds, until runs so long as it 
fails. Listing 2-11 shows the until loop syntax.
until some_condition; do x 
 run some commands until the condition is no longer false done
Listing 2-11 The until loop syntax
Listing 2-12 uses until to run some commands until a file’s size is greater than zero 
(meaning it is not empty).
#!/bin/bash
FILE="output.txt"
touch "${FILE}"
until [[ -s "${FILE}" ]]; do
echo "$FILE is empty..."
echo "Checking again in 2 seconds..."
sleep 2
done
echo "${FILE} appears to have some content in it!"
Listing 2-12 An until loop to check a file’s size
We first create an empty file, then begin a loop that runs until the file is no longer 
empty. Within the loop, we print some messages to the terminal. Save this file as 
until_loop.sh and run it:
$ chmod u+x until_loop.sh
$ ./until_loop.sh

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
47
output.txt is empty...
Checking again in 2 seconds...
$ **chmod u+x until_loop.sh**
$ **./until_loop.sh**
output.txt is empty...
Checking again in 2 seconds...
At this point, the script has created the file output.txt, but it’s an empty file. We 
can check this using the du command:
**du -sb output.txt**
output.txt
Open another terminal and navigate to the location at which your script is saved, 
then append some content to the file so its size is no longer zero:
$ echo "until_loop_will_now_stop!" > output.txt
The script should exit the loop, and you should see it print the following:
output.txt appears to have some content in it!
This script is available at https://github.com/dolevf/Black-Hat-
Bash/blob/master/ch02/until_loop.sh.
for
The for loop iterates over a sequence, such as a list of filenames, variables, or 
even group of values generated by running some command. Inside the for
loop, we define a block of commands that are run against each value in the list, 
and each value in the list is assigned to a variable name we define.
Listing 2-13 shows the syntax of a for loop.

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
48
for variable_name in LIST; do
# run some commands for each item in the sequence done
Listing 2-13 The for loop syntax
A simple way to use a for loop is to execute the same command a number of 
times. For example, the following code prints the numbers 1 through 10:
#!/bin/bash
for index in $(seq 1 10); do

Save and run this script. You should see the following output:

A more practical example might use a for loop to run commands against a bunch 
of IP addresses passed on the command line. The script in Listing 2-14 retrieves 

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
49
all arguments passed to the script, then iterates through them and prints a 
message for each:
#!/bin/bash
for ip_address in "$@"; do
echo "Taking some action on IP address ${ip_address}" done
Listing 2-14 A for loop to iterate through command line arguments
Save this script as for_loop_arguments.sh and run it as follows:
$ **chmod u+x for_loop_arguments.sh**
**./for_loop_arguments.sh 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 192.168.1.1 192.168
Taking some action on IP address 10.0.0.1
Taking some action on IP address 10.0.0.2
We can even run a for loop on the output of commands such as ls. In Listing 2-15, 
we print the names of all files in the current working directory:
#!/bin/bash
for file in $(ls .); do
echo "File: ${file}"
done
Listing 2-15 A for loop to iterate through a list of files in the current directory
We use a for loop to iterate over the output of the ls . command, which lists the 
files in the current directory. Each file will be assigned to the file variable as part 
of the for loop, so we can then use echo to print its name. This technique would 

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
50
be useful if we wanted to, for example, perform a file upload of all files in the 
directory or even rename them in bulk.
The break and continue statements
Loops can run forever or until a condition is met. But you can also exit a loop at 
any point using the break keyword. This keyword provides an alternative to the 
exit command, which would cause the entire script, and not just the loop, to exit. 
Using break, we can leave the loop and advance to the next code block:
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
echo "in the loop"
break
done
echo "This code block will be reached"
In this case, the last echo command will be executed.
The continue statement is used to jump to the next iteration of a loop. You can use 
it to skip a certain value in a sequence. To illustrate this, let’s create three empty 
files so we can iterate through them:
$ touch example_file1 example_file2 example_file3
Next, our for loop will write some content to each file, excluding the first one, 
example_file1, which it will leave empty (Listing 2-16).
#!/bin/bash
1 for file in example_file*; do

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
51
if [[ "${file}" == "example_file1" ]]; then echo "Skipping the f
2 continue
fi
echo "${RANDOM}" > "${file}"
done
Listing 2-16 The use of continue in a for loop
We start a for loop using the example_file* glob, which will expand to match the 
names of all files starting with example_file in the directory where the script runs 1. 
As a result, the loop should iterate over all three files we created earlier. Within the 
loop, we use a file test operator to check whether the filename is equal to 
example_file1 because we want to skip this file and not make any changes to it. If 
the condition is met, we use the continue statement 2 to proceed to the next 
iteration, leaving the file unmodified. Later in the loop, we use the echo command 
with the environment variable ${RANDOM} to generate a random number and 
write it into the file.
Save this script as for_loop_continue.sh and execute it in the same directory as 
the three files.
$ **chmod u+x for_loop_continue.sh**
$**./for_loop_continue.sh**
Skipping the first file.
If you examine the files, you should see that the first file is empty while the other 
two contain a random number as a result of the script echoing the value of the 
${RANDOM} environment variable into them.
Case Statements

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
52
In bash, case statements allow you to test multiple conditions in a cleaner way by 
using more readable syntax. Often, they help you avoid many if conditions, which 
can become harder to read as they grow in size.
Listing 2-17 shows the case statement syntax.
case EXPRESSION in
PATTERN1)
# do something if the first condition is met
;;
PATTERN2)
# do something if the second condition is met
;;
esac
case *EXPRESSION* in
*PATTERN1*)
# do something if the first condition is met
;;
*PATTERN2*)
# do something if the second condition is met
;;
esac
Listing 2-17 The case statement syntax
Case statements start with the keyword case followed by some expression, such 
as a variable you want to match a pattern against. PATTERN1 and

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
53
PATTERN2 in this example represent some pattern case (such as a regular 
expression, a string, or an integer) that you want to compare to the expression. To 
close a case statement, you use the keyword esac (case inverted).
Let’s take a look at an example case statement that checks whether an IP address 
is present in a specific private network (Listing 2-17).
#!/bin/bash
IP_ADDRESS="${1}"
case ${IP_ADDRESS} in
192.168.*)
echo "Network is 192.168.x.x"
;;
10.0.*)
echo "Network is 10.0.x.x"
;;
*)
echo "Could not identify the network."
;;
esac
Listing 2-18 A case statement to check an IP address and determine its network
We define a variable that expects one command line argument to be passed (${1}) 
and saves it to the IP_ADDRESS variable. We then use a pattern to check whether 

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
54
the IP_ADDRESS variable starts with 192.168. and a second pattern to checks 
whether it starts with 10.0..
We also define a default wildcard pattern using *, which returns a default message 
to the user if nothing else has matched.
Save this file as case_ip_address_check.sh and run it:
$ chmod u+x case_ip_address_check.sh
$./case_ip_address_check.sh 192.168.12.55
Network is 192.168.x.x
$./case_ip_address_check.sh 212.199.2.2
Could not identify the network.
$ **chmod u+x case_ip_address_check.sh**
$**./case_ip_address_check.sh 192.168.12.55**
Network is 192.168.x.x
$**./case_ip_address_check.sh 212.199.2.2**
Could not identify the network.
Text Processing and Parsing
One of the most common things you’ll find yourself doing in bash is processing 
text. You can parse text on the command line by running one-off commands, or 
use a script to store parsed data in a variable that you can act on in some way. In 
both cases, the skill is important to many scenarios.
To test the commands in this section on your own, download the sample log file 
from https://github.com/dolevf/Black-Hat-Bash/blob/master/ch02/log.txt. This file 
is space-separated, and each segment represents a specific data type, such as 
the client’s source IP address, timestamp, HTTP method, HTTP path, HTTP User 
Agent field, HTTP status code, and more.

Filtering with grep
The grep command is one of the most popular Linux commands out there
today. We use grep to filter out information of interest from streams. At its most
basic form, you can use it like so (Listing 2-19).
$ grep "35.237.4.214" log.txt
Listing 2-19 Filtering for a specific string from a file
This grep command will read the file and extract any lines containing the IP
address 35.237.4.214 from it.
We can even grep for multiple patterns simultaneously. The following
backslash pipe (\|) acts as an or condition (Listing 2-20).
$ grep "35.237.4.214\|13.66.139.0" log.txt
Listing 2-20 Filtering for two specific strings
Alternatively, you could use multiple grep patterns with the -e argument to
accomplish the same thing (Listing 2-21).
$ grep -e "35.237.4.214" -e "13.66.139.0" log.txt
Listing 2-21 Filtering for two specific strings with grep -e
As you learned in Chapter 1, we can use the pipe (|) command to provide one
command’s output as the input to another. In the following example, we run the
ps command and use grep to filter out a specific line. The ps command lists the
processes on the system:
$ ps | grep TTY
By default, grep is case sensitive. We can make our search case insensitive
using the -i flag (Listing 2-22).

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
56
$ ps | grep -i tty
Listing 2-22 A case-insensitive search with grep
We can also use grep to exclude lines containing a certain pattern using the
v argument, like in Listing 2-23.
$ grep -v "35.237.4.214" log.txt
Listing 2-23 Excluding lines containing a string
To print only the matched pattern, and not the entire line at which the matched
pattern was found, use -o (Listing 2-24).
$ grep -o "35.237.4.214" log.txt
Listing 2-24 Printing only the matching pattern
  
The command also supports regular expressions, anchoring, grouping, and
much more. Use the man grep command to read more about its capabilities.
Filtering with awk
The awk command is a data processing and extraction Swiss-army knife. You
can use it to identify and return specific fields from a file. To see how it works,
take another close look at our log file. What if we needed to print just the IP
addresses from this file? This is easy to do with awk (Listing 2-25).
$ awk '{print $1}' log.txt
Listing 2-25 Printing the first field
The $1 represents the first field of every line in the file, where the IP
addresses are. By default, awk treats spaces or tabs as separators or delimiters.

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
57
Using the same syntax, we can print additional fields, such as the timestamps.
Listing 2-26 filters the first three fields of every line in the file.
$ awk '{print $1,$2,$3}' log.txt
Listing 2-26 Printing the first three fields
Using similar syntax, we can print the first and last field simultaneously. In
this case, NF represents the last field (Listing 2-27).
$ awk '{print $1,$NF}' log.txt
Listing 2-27 Printing the first and last field
We can also change the default delimiter. For example, if we had a CSV file
separated by commas, rather than spaces or tabs, we could pass awk the -F flag 
to
specify the type of delimiter, as in Listing 2-28.
$ awk -F',' '{print $1}' example_csv.txt
Listing 2-28 Printing the first field using a comma delimiter
We can even use awk to print the first 10 lines of some file. This emulates the
behavior of the head Linux command. NR represents the total number of records
and is built into awk (Listing 2-29).
$ awk 'NR < 10' log.txt
Listing 2-29 Printing the first 10 lines of a file
You’ll often find it useful to combine grep and awk. For example, you
might want to first find the lines in a file containing the IP address 42.236.10.117
and then print the HTTP paths this IP made a request to (Listing 2-30).

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
58
$ grep "42.236.10.117" log.txt | awk '{print $7}'
Listing 2-30 Filtering an IP address and printing the seventh field, representing 
HTTP paths
The awk command is a super powerful tool, and we encourage you to dig deeper 
into its capabilities by running man awk for more information.
Editing Streams with sed
The sed (stream editor) command takes actions on text. For example, it can 
replace the text in a file, modify the text in some command’s output, and even 
delete selected lines from files.
Let’s use sed to replace any mentions of the word Mozilla with the word Godzilla 
in the log.txt file. We use its s (substitution) command and g (global) command to 
make the substitution across the whole file, rather than to just the first occurrence 
(Listing 2-31).
$ sed 's/Mozilla/Godzilla/g' log.txt
Listing 2-31 Replacing a string with another string
This will output the modified version of the file but won’t change the original 
version. You can redirect the output to a new file to save your changes:
$ sed 's/Mozilla/Godzilla/g' log.txt > newlog.txt
We could also use sed to remove any whitespace from the file with the / // syntax, 
which will replace whitespace with nothing, removing it from the output altogether 
(Listing 2-32).
$ sed 's/ //g' log.txt
Listing 2-32 Removing whitespace with sed

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
59
If you need to delete lines of a file, use the d command. In Listing 2-33, 1d deletes 
(d) the first line (1).
$ sed '1d' log.txt
Listing 2-33 Deleting the first line with sed
To delete the last line of a file, use the dollar sign ($), which represents the last 
line, along with d (Listing 2-34).
$ sed '$d' log.txt
Listing 2-34 Deleting the last line with sed
You can also delete multiple lines, such as line 5 and 7 (Listing 2-35).
$ sed '5,7d' log.txt
Listing 2-35 Deleting lines 5 and 7
Lastly, you can print specific line ranges, such as lines 2 through 15 (Listing 2-36).
$ sed -n '2,15 p' log.txt
Listing 2-36 Printing line ranges in a file
When you pass sed the -i argument, it will make the changes to the file itself 
rather than create a modified copy (Listing 2-37).
sed -i '1d' log.txt
Listing 2-37 Making changes to the original file
This rich utility can do a whole lot more. Use the man sed command to find 
additional ways to use sed.
Job Control

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
60
As you become proficient in bash, you’ll start to build complex scripts that take an 
hour to complete or must run continuously. Not all scripts need to execute in the 
foreground, blocking execution of other things. Instead, you may want to run 
certain scripts as background jobs, either because they take a while to
complete or because their runtime output isn’t interesting and you care only about 
the end result.
Commands that you run in a terminal occupy that terminal until the command is 
finished. These commands are considered foreground jobs. In Chapter 1, we used 
the ampersand character (&) to send a command to the background. This 
command then becomes a background job that allows us to unblock the execution 
of other commands.
Managing Background and Foreground Jobs
To practice working with foreground and background jobs, let’s run a command 
directly in the terminal and send it to the background:
$ sleep 100 &
Notice that we can continue working on the terminal while this sleep command 
runs for 100 seconds. You can verify the spawned process is running by using the 
ps command:
$ ps -ef | grep sleep
user 1827 1752 cons0 19:02:29 /usr/bin/sleep
Now that this job is in the background, we can use the jobs command to see what 
jobs are currently running (Listing 2-38).
$ **jobs**
[1]+ Running sleep 100 &
Listing 2-38 Listing jobs

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
61
The output shows that the sleep command is in Running state and that its job ID is 
1.
 
We can migrate the job from the background to the foreground by issuing the fg 
command and the job ID (Listing 2-39).
$ **fg %1**
sleep 100
Listing 2-39 Sending a job to the foreground
At this point, the sleep command is occupying the terminal, since it’s running in 
the foreground. You can press CTRL+Z to suspend the process, which will 
produce the following output in the jobs table:
[1]+ Stopped sleep 100
To send this job to the background again in a running state, use the bg command 
with the job ID (Listing 2-40).
$ **bg %1**
[1]+ sleep 100 &
Listing 2-40 Sending a job to the background
Keeping a Job Running After Logout
Whether you send a job to the background or are running a job in the foreground, 
the process won’t survive if you close the terminal or log out. If you close the 
terminal, the process will receive a SIGHUP signal and terminate.
What if we wanted to keep running a script in the background even after we’ve 
logged out of the terminal window or closed it? To do so, we could start a script or 
command with the nohup (no hangup) command prepended (Listing 2-41).

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
62
$ nohup ./my_script.sh &
Listing 2-41 Keeping a script running after closing the terminal or logging out
The nohup command will create a file named nohup.out with standard output 
stream data. So, make sure you delete this file if you don't want to leave any 
traces on the disk.
There are additional ways to run background scripts, such as by plugging into 
system and service managers like systemd, which provide additional features, 
such as monitoring that the process is running, restarting it if it isn’t, and capturing 
failures. We encourage you to read more about systemd if you have such use-
cases at https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/init.1.html.
Bash Customizations for Penetration Testers
As penetration testers, we often follow standard workflows for all ethical hacking 
engagements, whether they be consulting work, bug bounty hunting, or red 
teaming. We can optimize some of this work with a few bash tips and tricks.
Placing Scripts in Searchable Paths
Bash searches for programs within directories defined by the PATH
environment variable. Commands such as ls are always available to you because 
system and user binaries are located in directories that are part of the PATH.
To see your PATH, run the following command:
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
$ **echo $PATH**
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
The output might change depending on the operating system you use.

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
63
When you write a bash script, place it in a directory such as /usr/local/bin, which, 
as you can see, is part of the PATH. If you don’t do this, you have a few other 
options available to you:
Call the script directly using the full path.
Change the directory to the one in which your script lives and execute it from 
there.
Use aliases (shown in the next section).
Adding additional paths to the PATH environment variable
The benefit of placing the script in a searchable path is that you can simply call it 
by its name. You don’t have to provide the full path or have the terminal be in the 
same directory.
Shortening Commands with Aliases
When you find yourself frequently using a long Linux command, you can make 
use of an alias to map it to a shorter custom name that will save you time when 
you need to run it.
For example, imagine that you often use Nmap with special parameters to scan for 
all 65,535 ports on a given IP address:
nmap -vv -T4 -p- -sV --max-retries 5 localhost
This command is quite hard to remember. With aliases, we can make it more 
accessible on the command line or to our scripts. Here, we assign the command 
to the alias quickmap:
$ alias quicknmap="nmap -vv -T4 -p- -sV --max-retries 5 localhos
Now we can run the aliased command using the name of the alias:
$ quicknmap
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-02-21 22:32 EST

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
64
PORT STATE SERVICE
631/tcp open ipp
You can even assign an alias to your own scripts:
$ alias helloworld="bash ~/scripts/helloworld.sh"
Aliases aren’t permanent, but they can be. In the next section, you’ll learn how to 
use bash profiles to make permanent changes to your shell.
Customizing the Bash Run Commands Profile (bashrc)
We can use the ~/.bashrc file to load functions, variables, and just about any other 
custom bash code we desire into a new bash session. For example, we can create 
variables containing information we’ll frequently need to access, such as the IP 
address of a vulnerable host we’re testing.
For example, we could append the following to the end of the ~/.bashrc file. These 
lines define a few custom variables and save our aliased Nmap command:
VULN_HOST=1.0.0.22
VULN_ROUTER=10.0.0.254
alias quicknmap="nmap -vv -T4 -p- -sV --max-retries 5 example.lo
The next time you open a terminal, you’ll be able to access these values. Make 
these new values available immediately by re-importing the ~/.bashrc file using 
the source command:
$ **source ~/.bashrc**
$ **echo $VULN_HOST**
10.0.0.22

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
65
$ **echo $VULN_ROUTER**
10.0.0.254
Now you can use these variables even after you close the terminal and start a new 
session.
Importing Custom Scripts
Another way to introduce changes to your bash session is to create a dedicated 
script that contains pentesting-related customizations and have the ~/.bashrc file 
import it using the source command. To achieve this, create a ~/.pentest.sh file 
containing your new logic, and then make a one-time modification to ~/.bashrc to 
import it at the end of the file:
source ~/.pentest.sh
 
Note that you can also source a bash file using the . command, as in Listing 42.
. ~/.pentest.sh
Listing 2-42 An alternative to the source command
Capturing Terminal Session Activity
Penetration testing often involves having dozens of terminals open
simultaneously, all running many tools that can produce a lot of output. When we 
find something of interest, we may need some of that output as evidence for later. 
To avoid losing track of an important piece of information, we can make use of 
some clever bash.
The script command allows us to capture terminal session activity. One way to 
use it is to load a small bash script that uses script to save every session to a file 
for later inspection. The script might look like this:

Hacking with Kali Linux - Part 2 - Bash Scripting
66
#!/bin/bash
FILENAME="$(date +%m-%d-%y)_${RANDOM}.log"
if [[ ! -d ~/sessions ]]; then
mkdir ~/sessions
fi
# Starting a script session
script -f -a "~/sessions/${FILENAME}"
Having ~/.bashrc load this script, as showed earlier, will result in the creation of 
the ~/sessions directory containing each terminal session capture in a separate 
file. The recording stops once you enter exit in the terminal or close the entire 
terminal window.
